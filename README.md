- **Photo memories** - upload images that float around your tree
- **Teddy bear and gift decorations** with animated effects
- **Share functionality** - save and share your personalized tree via unique URLs
- **Responsive 3D graphics** using Three.js with smooth particle physics

##  About This Project

This project is **100% AI-generated vibe coding** - a creative exploration of what's possible when you let AI build something purely for the aesthetic and experience. The entire HTML/JavaScript codebase was generated through AI prompting and iteration.

##  Open Source

This project is open source and available for anyone to use, modify, and learn from. Feel free to:
- Customize the colors, particles, and effects
- Add your own features and interactions
- Use it as a gift or personal project
- Learn from the Three.js and MediaPipe implementations

##  Customization

Look for `<!-- Customize: ... -->` comments in the HTML to personalize:
- Page title and heading
- Loading screen text  
- App identifier for Firebase integration

##  Usage

Simply open `tree.html` in a modern web browser. Grant camera permissions to enable hand gesture controls.

**Controls:**
- Open your hand 🖐️ to scatter the tree particles
- Pinch gesture 🤏 to rotate the tree
- Upload photos to add memories around your tree
- Share your creation with the "保存记忆" (Save Memory) button

##  Technologies

- Three.js for 3D graphics
- MediaPipe Hands for gesture recognition
- Firebase for data persistence and sharing
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework needed!)
